                    The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3)
                     high containment facility.
                    The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology.
                     Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects.
                      They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a 
                      defensive reaction against an infection.</p>
