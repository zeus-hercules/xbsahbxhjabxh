        <p id = "p"> Before the coronavirus dominated our lives, many of us may have taken human interaction for granted.
             Spending time with our immediate loved ones now, however, has taken center stage. Despite the frustrations the 
             daily confinement may naturally bring, it’s important to reflect on what our family and friends truly mean to us.
              As restrictions begin to lift, seeing those we haven’t been able to connect with face-to-face will feel that much
               more special. Maybe we’ll even share more smiles and hellos with those we don’t know.</p>

               <h2 id = "h2">2.There’s no place like the outdoors</h2>
               <img id = "img" src = "Outdoors.jpg">
               <br>
               <p id = "p">Our homes may have become sanctuaries in a way we didn’t anticipate. Yet whether it’s gardening, hiking or 
                   walking through a park, or just poking our heads out the front door for some fresh air and sunlight, the great outdoors
                    has remained a viable escape. The world may have ceased to exist as we once knew it, but nature endures.</p>

                    <img id = "img" src = "Prevention.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <p id = "p">What we eat, our exercise habits and general handwashing/hygiene awareness have garnered greater focus. 
                        When it comes to our health and wellness, there is power in ownership and prevention.</p>

                    <h2 id = "h2">4.Hobbies are healing</h2>
                    <img id = "img" src = "Hobbie.png">
                    <br>
                    <p id = "p">From cooking and knitting to painting and learning a new language, our renewed enthusiasm 
                        for pastimes has helped to recharge our health batteries, not to mention build connections with our
                         families. For example, the simple act of baking bread with a son or daughter can nurture an important
                          life skill, as well as create a cherished memory.</p>
                        <br>

                    <h2 id = "h2">5.Our minds matter</h2>
                    <img id = "img" src = "Mind.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <p id = "p">While the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted newfound worries, it’s also forced us to slow down and evaluate how we
                         cope with stress. Has this resulted in a desire to learn yoga, meditation or mindfulness? Whatever the path to reducing
                          stress and improving mental wellness, it’s worth staying the course once things return closer to where they used to be.</p>

                          <br>
                          <p id = "p">t’s long overdue—delivery drivers, supermarket employees, health care professionals and other essential 
                              workers are finally receiving the recognition they deserve. The sacrifices they’ve particularly made during this 
                              pandemic haven’t gone unnoticed. Showing gratitude for these everyday heroes will go a long way toward building
                               lasting goodwill.</p>

                                    when we act together. The lessons we absorb and the energy we put into making positive choices today will make a meaningful
