                     <p id = "p">COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. 
                             In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever
                              may not be a symptom for some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal congestion,
                               runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and
                                don't feel unwell. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out 
                                of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.</p>

                                <p id = "p">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from
                                         person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a 
                                         person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                                          the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and
                                           then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe
                                            in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.</p>
